## Data Sources:
- Main data was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and downloaded as a [CSV file](Data/starting_7351.csv).
- The Kaggle CSV file was then combined with data from [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) using requests via Python in the [OMDB_API_Pull Notebook](Data/OMDB_API_Pull.ipynb). 
    - Cleaning of the data was done in the aforementioned Jupyter Notebook.
- The cleaned dataframe of the OMDb and Kaggle data were then combined into a single dataframe which was then output as a [CSV File](Data/starting_7351.csv).
    - A [subset CSV](Data/final_1688.csv) of the aforementioned CSV File was created to have a more accurate list of Actors and Directors.
    - These 2 CSV files were used as our main dataset to perform data analyses in our [Data Analysis Notebook](Data/Data_Analysis.ipynb).
